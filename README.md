# Advent of Code 2021 - Rust edition
Done these in the last couple years with python. I think that's for the most part the perfect language for these challenges.

But it's also a great way to focus on learning something new, especially when you focus on doing things in a particular way. For example, 
you could try to use iterators, or generators, or functional programming etc as much as possible.

Anyway, this year I'll play around a bit with Rust. I'm not trying to overpolish things, so not everything that could be generic will be 
generic etc. But I try and see what looks idiomatic, and in the process learn some more of the intricacies of the trait system, lifetimes, 
and the borrow checker.

See individual day's writeups in the docs folder.
